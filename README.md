### [Project 1 - FoodHub Data Analysis](https://github.com/aishatyusuf/pgp-dsba-projects/tree/master/Project%201%20-%20FoodHub%20Data%20Analysis)

Course: Python - Foundations

In this project, a food aggregator company has stored the data of orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. Data Analysis was performed to draw some actionable insights for the business.

### [Project 2 - E-news Express](https://github.com/aishatyusuf/pgp-dsba-projects/tree/master/Project%202%20-%20E-news%20Express)

Course: Business Statistics

This project used statistical analysis, A/B testing, and visualization to decide if the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Also, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will be analyzed in this project.

### [Project 3 - ReCell](https://github.com/aishatyusuf/pgp-dsba-projects/tree/master/Project%203%20-%20ReCell)

Course: Supervised Learning - Foundations

In this project, a used devices dataset was analyzed, and a linear regression model was built to help develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices and identify factors that significantly influence the price.

### [Project 4 - INNHotelsGroup](https://github.com/aishatyusuf/pgp-dsba-projects/tree/master/Project%204%20-%20INNHotelsGroup)

Course: Supervised Learning - Classification

In this project, the data of INN Hotels was analyzed to discover which factors have a high influence on booking cancellation, and a predictive model was built to predict which booking will be canceled in advance and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

### [Project 5 - EasyVisa](https://github.com/aishatyusuf/pgp-dsba-projects/tree/master/Project%205%20-%20EasyVisa)

Course: Ensemble Techniques

In this project, using ensemble techniques, a predictive model was built to facilitate the process of visa approvals and based on important factors that significantly influence visa status, to recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied.


### [Project 6 - Renewind](https://github.com/aishatyusuf/pgp-dsba-projects/tree/master/Project%206%20-%20Renewind)

Course: Model Tuning

"ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data on generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. The objective is to build various classification models, tune them, and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generator can be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.

### [Project 7 - Trade & Ahead](https://github.com/aishatyusuf/pgp-dsba-projects/tree/master/Project%207%20-%20Trade%20%26%20Ahead)


Course: Unsupervised learning

In the project, the objective was to analyze stock data, using unsupervised learning techniques, group the stocks based on the attributes provided, and share insights about the characteristics of each group.
